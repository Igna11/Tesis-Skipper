# Skipper-CCD image analysis
A set of python (and jupyter) files with different image analysis for my thesis.
The .ipynb are all the work I've been doing by now, with all steps explained with some level of detail.

#### Analisis_Imagenes.ipynb:
General analysis of the images. First steps in understanding the data and characteristics of the CCD sensor.

#### Analisis_Imagenes_probabilidades.ipynb
Two ways for computing the probability of having one electron events in a given pixel. The main idea is, suppossing a Poissonian distribution for the random variable "number of events per pixel", computing the expected value $\mu$

#### Analisis_Imagenes_clusters.ipynb

#### Analisis_Imagenes_bordes.ipynb
